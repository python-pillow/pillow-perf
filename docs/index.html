    <h1>Pillow Performance</h1>

    <section>
        <h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
        <p>
            On this page, you'll find estimates
            of Pillow's performance, a comparison of 
            Pillow's performance with Pillow-SIMD
            (a special performance-optimized version of
            Pillow), and other graphic libraries.
            Mainly Python libraries are tested.
        <p>
            Unfortunately, there is no single performance
            metric for these libraries.
            Different libraries perform operations
            with different efficiency and sometimes in different ways.
            It is only possible to measure the performance
            of a single operation or group of operations.
            For a good comparison, you need to be sure
            that the tested libraries give
            the same outcome for an operation
            and the same resources
            are used to perform the operation.

        <h3 id="same-outcome">Same outcome</h3>
        <p>
            An operation could be performed
            using different algorithms.
            Thus, the chosen algorithm
            can significantly affect the result. 
            For example, if you want to perform a resize,
            you can use the very fast nearest neighbor algorithm
            and get very poor quality.
            Or you can use convolution resampling and get
            a reasonable quality for most cases.
            Depending on your needs, you can or can not
            consider the nearest neighbor method.
        <p>
            In these benchmarks, we always assume that
            you expect results
            as close as possible to each other.
            This allows to directly compare the execution time.

        <h3 id="same-resources">Same resources</h3>
        <p>
            Some libraries could use more processing power than others.
            For example, graphics processing unit
            or multi-core CPUs.

            For some cases, this could be an advantage
            because it shrinks execution time.
            For example, if the execution time
            using one core is 2 seconds,
            the library can reduce it to 0.5 seconds
            using 4 cores.
            This library has an advantage over the library
            which performs the same operation in 1 second
            but can't use multiple cores.
        <p>
            However, sometimes overall throughput
            is more important than execution time.
            If you need to perform the operation
            on a group of images, you can do it in parallel.
            In this case, the first library's throughput
            remains the same: 2 operations per second.
            The second library's throughput
            is 4 operations per second.
            The second library is preferred.
        <p>
            In these benchmarks, we measure the throughput
            on single CPU core, not minimum achievable execution time.

        <h3 id="test-suites">Test suites</h3>
        <p>
            Libraries with Python bindings are tested using
            <a href="https://github.com/python-pillow/pillow-perf#automatic-test">
                pillow-perf test suites</a>.
            <!--Skia is tested using

                test files</a>.-->
            Each test is run 11 times
            and the mean execution time is calculated.

        <h2 id="resampling">Convolution Resampling</h2>
        <p>
            Image resampling is one of the most common processing operations.
            Good and predictable quality can be achieved using
            <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/Usage/filter/#filter">
                the convolution-based</a> method.
        <p>
            "Convolution" means that for each pixel of the final image
            we compute some area ("window")
            of the source image using weights.
            The size of the area and weights depend on the chosen filter.
            There are many filters.
            The most common of which are:
        <ul>
            <li><code>Bilinear</code> — high-efficiency filter
                with the small window and a blurry result;</li>
            <li><code>Bicubic</code> — high-quality filter with medium window;</li>
            <li><code>Lanczos</code> — high-quality filter with large window.</li>
        </ul>   
        <p>
            For the image downscaling
            the window size should be increased.
            This takes into account
            all pixels of the original image.
            Unfortunately, not all libraries and software do this.
            As a result, the output image can look extra sharp and crisp.
            In some cases, the result
            only vaguely resembles the original image.
        <p>
            These are the results of resizing a
            <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/OLlj17tUZnU" target="_blank">
                4928 × 3280 px image</a> to 210 × 140 px
            using different software and different filters.
            Google Сhome's <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> implementation
            doesn't increase the window size on downscaling.
            <a href="#library-opencv">OpenCV</a>
            also doesn't do this using the <code>Bicubic</code> filter
            but it offers a supersampling resampling method.

        <div class="samples">
            <figure>
                <img src="./static/space_chrome.png" alt="Google Chrome" width="210" />
                <figcaption>Google Chrome canvas</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>
                <img src="./static/space_cv2_cubic.png" alt="OpenCV Cubic" width="210" />
                <figcaption>OpenCV Cubic</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <figure>

                <figcaption>OpenCV Area (supersampling)</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>
            Obviously, it's meaningless to compare OpenCV's
            <code>Bicubic</code> performance
            with the correct convolution implementations.
            Also, supersampling is a different resampling method,
            not based on convolutions.
            It is correct for downscaling
            but unacceptable for upscaling.
        <p>
            From the very beginning, 
            <a href="#library-pil">PIL</a>
            also didn't increase the window size
            for <code>Bilinear</code> and <code>Bicubic</code> filters,
            but it did for <code>Antialias</code>
            (the real name of the filter is
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm">
                Lanczos</a>).
            In Pillow <code>2.7.0</code> this was finally fixed.

        <div class="samples">

                <img src="./static/space_pil_bicubic.png" alt="PIL Bicubic" width="210" />

        </div>
        <p>
            On the other hand, some image libraries do convolutions right.
            For example, <a href="#library-imagemagick">ImageMagick</a>.
            The problem with ImageMagick is that resampling is very slow.
            For example, it's about 20 times slower than
            <a href="#library-skia">Skia</a>
            which can also do high-quality convolution resampling.
        <p>
            From the very beginning, PIL and Pillow resampling
            performance used to be quite low
            and similar to ImageMagick's performance.
            Pillow 2.7 reverses the trend
            introducing several common optimizations
            such as loops rearrangement
            and cache-aware transposition.

        <p>
            Charts show median performance in Megapixels/s (the lower the better)
            required for resizing the source 2560x1600 RGB image
            to one of the four destination sizes
            using one of the filters.
            For significant downsampling, Pillow 2.7 is
            <b>2 — 4 times</b> faster than PIL.
            Pillow 3.3 introduces fixed-point arithmetic
            for resampling which is even faster.
            Pillow 3.4 and 4.3 have additional optimizations
            for large target dimensions.
            In the end, current Pillow version is
            <b>up to 7 times</b> faster than the original PIL.
        <p>
            But this is not the end of the story.
            Starting with Pillow 3.2 you can use a
            <a href="#library-pillow-simd">SIMD-enabled Pillow version</a>.
            Pillow-SIMD resampling performance is significantly increased
            compared to Pillow.
            The latest Pillow-SIMD compiled with AVX2
            is <b>4 — 6 times</b> faster than Pillow.
            In sum, Pillow-SIMD resampling performance is

        <h2 id="blur">Gaussian Blur</h2>
        <p>
            High-quality
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur">
                Gaussian blur</a>
            can be used to reduce image noise and details.
            It is also used as a pre-processing stage
            in computer vision algorithms.
        <p>
            Mathematically, applying a Gaussian blur to an image
            is the same as convolving the image with a Gaussian function.
            The amount of blur depends on standard deviation size (sigma).
            In theory, the Gaussian function is infinite.
            It means that we need to compute every pixel of the source image
            for every pixel in the destination image.
            In practice, Gaussian is a rapidly decreasing function
            and a window size more than 3 * sigma has no meaning.
        <p>
            As a result, Gaussian blur performance should depend
            on window size and sigma.
            For most implementations this is true.
            But in 2011 Mathematical Image Analysis Group
            from Saarland University
            <a href="https://www.mia.uni-saarland.de/Publications/gwosdek-ssvm11.pdf">
                proved</a>
            that Gaussian blur can be very closely approximated by
            series of extended box filters.
            Unlike a true Gaussian filter,
            box filter can be performed in constant time
            relative to blur radius.
        <p>
            This approach was implemented in Pillow <code>2.7.0</code>.
            According to the tests, even if approximation with box filters
            could be little slower with a small sigma,
            with a larger sigma this gap disappears and 
            approximation becomes much faster.
            SIMD gives an additional 2x boost.

        <p>
            This is a group of operations
            which is most relevant when
            an image has an orientation flag stored in EXIF.
            The group includes such operations as
            rotating by right angles, mirroring and
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose">
                transposition</a> itself.
            It differs from regular rotation because
            these operations are non-destructive
            (ie pixel values are not modified)
            and can be performed very fast.
        <p>
            Mirroring and rotating by 180° are reasonably fast
            in most implementations.
            There was an issue in Pillow
            with rotating by 90° and 270°
            because those operations can consume
            CPU cache highly inefficiently.
            In Pillow 2.7 the cache-aware algorithm was implemented.
            Also, transposition was added.

            Conversion from <code>RGBA</code> to <code>RGBa</code>
            can be used to normalize pixel values
            before resizing and other transformations.

                Alpha compositing</a>
            is used for overlaying two semitransparent images.
            Unlike alpha blending,
            alpha compositing mixes color and alpha channels
            with different coefficients.
